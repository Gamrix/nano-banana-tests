    "background": "Born to a long line of financiers who believed commerce was the highest form of piety, Thaddeus was raised among the towering glass temples of San Francisco's financial district. He received rigorous, high-society training intended to mold him into a beacon of corporate virtue, destined to uphold the legacy of his family's wealth and moral standing. However, a deep yearning for adventure and high-seas freedom clashed with his gilded upbringing, setting him on a path of luxurious self-discovery and spiritual confusion.",

    "signature_pose": "Thaddeus stands bolt upright, right hand resting on the hilt of his ornate cutlass, while his left hand holds the golden espresso tamper aloft, catching the light in a professional, almost reverent manner."
